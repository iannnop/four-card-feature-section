## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Tailwind CSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

## What I learned

I just wanted to reinforce my knowledge and practice more with CSS Flexbox. I thought the layout was different from other flexbox layouts, and it helped me think outside of the box. For example, my first approach was to do something with `flex-wrap` and `flex-direction: row`, but the approach that ended up working was to treat the card section as a set of three columns.

Thinking outside of the box and trying different methods to approach a design is a good skill to practice.

## Continued development

This was a small layout challenge that I wanted to do before I move on to harder challenges. It'll help reinforce the basics while I learn more complex features and libraries in React.

A good trick that I ended up learning is that sometimes it's better to center things with `width: %` and `margin: auto` rather than to use grid or flex centering methods.
